We propose a novel and efficient image tampering detection network named the multi-scale self-knowledge distillation network (MSSKD-Net). Firstly, we employ HRNet as the feature extractor. HRNet uses parallel connections of high- and low-resolution features across its four stages, maintaining high resolution at every layer. This design ensures that the extracted features at four different scales are spatially more precise and semantically richer, facilitating more accurate tampering detection and region localization in subsequent steps. Additionally, we utilize the curvature-enhanced Sobel edge algorithm to amplify the artifacts at the edges of tampering regions, improving detection efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we integrate BiFPN and self-distillation techniques to help the network deeply explore the relationships between multi-scale tampering features. This approach enables better capture of both global information and local details in images, addressing complex tampering scenarios and delivering more reliable results.
